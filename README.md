# EdgeDetectionUsingACOA
Image Edge Detection using Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm (Java)

Abstract:
 In this project a new algorithm for edge detection using ant colony search is
proposed. The problem is represented by a directed graph in which nodes are the
pixels of an image. To adapt the problem, some modifications on original ant colony
search algorithm (ACSA) are applied. A large number of experiments are employed
to determine suitable algorithm parameters. We drive an experimental relationship
between the size of the image to be analyzed and algorithm parameters. Several
experiments are made and the results suggest the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm
